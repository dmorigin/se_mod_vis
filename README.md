## Code

I use the MDK from https://github.com/malware-dev/MDK-SE. Big thanks to this VS Addon. The MDK-SE is an Addon for Visual Studio to manage the code for SE Scripts. I use the community version of Visual Studio. This Version comes with all that you need. You find the code under the folder "VisualInformationSystem".

## Introduction

This is a script for the programmable block (PB) in Space Engineers (SE). With this script it is possible to show different information on a display in different ways. Inside the wiki you will find the documentation. I recommend that you read the documentation so that you understand exactly what happens.
